# Introduction
In this assignment, I have built a program that allows a client to interact with an API that makes queries to the 'nails' database to book and cancel nail appointments with different nail technicians.

## Instructions for using API
These are the instructions for how to use the API yourself!

### Create SQL database

1. Open MYSQL database and connect.
2. Open the 'create_db.sql' file.
3. Run lines 1-52 to create 'nails' database and populate 'nail_bookings' table with availability of 3 nail technicians for the next three months.
4. Run line 55 to get your SQL host name and user name for editing your config file in the next step. e.g., mine returns 'root@localhost', which means by user name is 'root' and my host is 'localhost'.

### Edit config file
1. Open your IDE (e.g., visual studio code or pycharm).
2. Open 'config.py' file.
3. Edit line 2 and 3 with your SQL host name and user name (see above).
3. Add your own MYSQL password to line 3.
